Transaction Example:
----------------------------

mysql_query("SET AUTOCOMMIT=0");
mysql_query("START TRANSACTION");

$a1 = mysql_query("INSERT INTO rarara (l_id) VALUES('1')");
$a2 = mysql_query("INSERT INTO rarara (l_id) VALUES('2')");

if ($a1 and $a2) {
    mysql_query("COMMIT");
} else {        
    mysql_query("ROLLBACK");
}




Coupling:
------------------

Tight Coupling
--------------------------
Tight coupling is when a group of classes are highly dependent on one another.
This scenario arises when a class assumes too many responsibilities, or when one concern is spread over many classes rather than having its own class.
Loose coupling is achieved by means of a design that promotes single-responsibility and separation of concerns.


Loose Coupling
--------------------------
A loosely-coupled class can be consumed and tested independently of other (concrete) classes.
